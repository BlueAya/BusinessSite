                    My name's Sharon and I've been fixing cars since I was 8 years old. My uncle owned a shop back in Arizona and I would help him after school. Ever since my first tire change, I couldn't get enough. Your car's in good hands with me.

                    My mom was a professional NASCAR racer so I've been around cars my whole life. I would often talk to the pit crew in between my mom's races and it's those interactions and conversations that's developed my appreciation for these fantastic creations. Your car's in good hands with me.

                    My dad taught me everything I know about cars and every week since I was old enough to read, he would give me a new car manual to study. It was through these manuals that I grew to appreciate just how intricate our vehicles that we use everyday are and what sparked my interest in becoming a mechanic. You car's in good hands with me.
